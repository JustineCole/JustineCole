### About Me
I'm a South African medical doctor specialised in biochemical and molecular diagnostics and laboratory management. I have a penchant for adding value through logic and optimisation, and I'm making my dreams come true by adding coding skills (mostly Python, also R) to my toolkit. I love deep-diving into what I'm learning or building and then giving talks about it when I'm done.
